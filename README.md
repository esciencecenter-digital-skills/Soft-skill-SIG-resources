# Soft-skill-SIG-resources
Resources from the soft skill SIG of the Netherlands eScience Center

At the Netherlands eScience Center we have several special interest groups (SIGs), including one on soft skills. Most SIGs are open to the public, but the soft skill SIG is only meant for employees of the eScience Center to allow for people to speak openly about any topics or concerns they might have. This doesn't mean that we can not share some of the materials we have collected over time. Please feel free to have a look around and let us know if you want to re-use some of these materials by sending an email to training@esciencecenter.nl or info@esciencencenter.nl.
